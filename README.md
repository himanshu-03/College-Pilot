## Description
The Placement Pilot is an innovative platform designed to streamline the recruitment process within educational institutions. It serves as a bridge between the Training and Placement (TnP) officer, companies seeking to recruit talent from the campus, and the students themselves. The portal provides a centralized hub where students can access crucial information about upcoming placement activities, company profiles, schedules, and application processes. Moreover, it facilitates seamless communication between stakeholders, automates administrative tasks, promotes transparency, and ensures equal access to employment opportunities for all students. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, the Placement Pilot aims to enhance the efficiency, fairness, and effectiveness of campus placements.
